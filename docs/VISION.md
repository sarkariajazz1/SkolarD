## Vision Statement
SkolarD is a tutoring platform created to make it easier for post-secondary students to get help with their studies by booking in-person sessions with tutors. Its main goal is to offer students a convenient way to find support tailored specifically to the courses they’re taking. Whether a student is looking for help in a difficult class, preparing for an upcoming exam, or trying to stay ahead, SkolarD helps them find the right tutor at the right time. Students can search for tutors who are available at times that work for them, who have either the highest ratings on the platform or the strongest academic record in the course they need help with. This enables students to connect with tutors who have a deep understanding of the subject and can explain it effectively.

SkolarD is designed for students at universities, colleges, or technical schools who are struggling with specific courses or topics. Finding a tutor who has taken the exact same course, especially at the same school can be difficult. Particularly in science and technical programs where course content and teaching styles can differ widely. SkolarD solves this by helping students connect with tutors who have firsthand experience in that exact course. This makes the support more focused, easier to understand, and directly relevant to what the student is learning in class. It leads to better sessions and stronger results. 

Tutors on the platform can include peers who have successfully completed the course or former instructors familiar with the material. Users can choose to be a tutor, a student, or both which allows students who excel in some subjects to give back while still receiving support in others. This reciprocal model creates a peer-driven learning environment where students support each other’s academic growth.

The core value of SkolarD is its ability to help students find tutors who understand both the course material and the way each student learns best. This personal match leads to more productive sessions, clearer explanations, and better results over time. Students are more likely to stay motivated and feel supported when they’re working with someone who truly gets how they learn. The platform is currently being developed as a website that all users can access easily, with future plans to expand to mobile devices for even greater convenience. It will also offer secure messaging and private user profiles to ensure safety and comfort during communication.

SkolarD’s success in its first year will be evaluated using realistic, measurable goals. These include reaching 2,000 registered users within the first year, with at least 40% of students booking at least one session; achieving an average of three sessions per student per semester; and seeing at least 40% of students book a repeat session within 30 days. Additionally, 60% of users should self-report improved grades or understanding in the subject area through structured surveys, and user satisfaction should average 4.0 out of 5 based on feedback. Through these metrics, SkolarD aims to demonstrate meaningful academic impact while maintaining a manageable and scalable user base in its first year.
