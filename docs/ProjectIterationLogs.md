## Summary of Changes

### 1. Logic Refactoring

- Eliminated unused or template code remnants from imported project structure.

- Ensured objects were only deleted if they existed and added validations for duplication.

- Removed mutable returns in `getItem()` and protected internal lists using unmodifiable views.

- Extracted abstract responsibilities into proper abstract classes where applicable.

- Introduced clear subclass responsibilities for sorting logic with improved `PriorityList` hierarchy.


### 2. Improved Sorting Strategy

- Replaced manual sort logic (e.g., bubble sort) with `Collections.sort()` and comparators.

- Ensured all sortable objects implement consistent comparator logic.


### 3. Object Model Adjustments

- Refactored class hierarchies for `Tutor`, `Student`, and `User` to clarify responsibility boundaries.

- Avoided tight coupling and enhanced modularity in profile and session management.


### 4. Persistence Enhancements

- Removed redundant or shallow database references.

- Standardized ID and email uniqueness validations.

- Ensured accurate handling of optional fields (e.g., `OptionalDouble`).


### 5. UI and Miscellaneous Fixes

- Reduced hardcoded strings by introducing a centralized config file.

- Improved message feedback and error propagation.
