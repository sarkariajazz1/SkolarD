#  SkolarD

SkolarD is a tutoring platform created to help post-secondary students book personalized, in-person tutoring sessions with ease. It enables students to find tutors based on specific courses and preferred teaching styles, making academic support more targeted and relevant. Once a tutor is selected, students can view their availability and schedule a session at a mutually convenient time. The platform also supports direct communication between students and tutors for further clarity and coordination.

SkolarD is designed for students attending universities, colleges, or technical institutions who are struggling with particular courses or concepts. Finding a tutor who has taken the same course, especially at the same institution, can be a challenge—particularly in science and technical programs. SkolarD addresses this issue by matching students with tutors who have direct experience with the exact course, improving the relevance and efficiency of academic support.

Tutors on the platform can include peers who have successfully completed the course or former instructors familiar with the material. Users can choose to be a tutor, a student, or both—allowing students who excel in some subjects to give back while still receiving support in others. This reciprocal model creates a peer-driven learning environment where students support each other’s academic growth.

The core value of SkolarD is its ability to match students with tutors who understand both the content and the student’s learning style. This leads to more productive sessions and an overall improvement in academic outcomes. The platform is currently envisioned as a website accessible to all users, with plans to expand to mobile platforms in the future. It will include secure messaging and privacy-respecting user profiles.

SkolarD’s success in its first year will be evaluated using realistic, measurable goals. These include reaching 2,000 registered users within the first year, with at least 40% of students booking at least one session; achieving an average of three sessions per student per semester; and seeing at least 40% of students book a repeat session within 30 days. Additionally, 60% of users should self-report improved grades or understanding in the subject area through structured surveys, and user satisfaction should average 4.0 out of 5 based on feedback. Through these metrics, SkolarD aims to demonstrate meaningful academic impact while maintaining a manageable and scalable user base in its first year.
