# SkolarD

SkolarD is an all-in-one tutoring management system designed to streamline academic support for both students and tutors. Built as a desktop Java Swing application, it combines session booking, messaging, payment tracking, and post-session rating in a unified interface.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Project Purpose

The goal of SkolarD is to provide a professional and seamless tutoring experience. It enables:

- **Students** to discover tutors by course, view tutor qualifications, book and unbook sessions, communicate with tutors, and rate sessions after completion.
- **Tutors** to create and manage available sessions, respond to messages, and monitor feedback.
- **Administrators** to later integrate analytics and oversee platform engagement (future scope).

This project was designed as part of a final-year university capstone and reflects real-world system design, usability principles, and code organization practices.

## ðŸ’Ž Why SkolarD Is Valuable

- **Efficient Scheduling**: Students can easily search and book sessions by course, tutor rating, or availability.
- **Two-Way Communication**: Built-in messaging allows asynchronous coordination between tutors and students.
- **Feedback Loop**: Rating requests are automatically generated and tracked, ensuring quality and transparency.
- **Session Integrity**: Booked sessions can be managed with refund logic, and unbooked sessions automatically skip feedback collection.
- **User-Centric Design**: Simple GUI layouts tailored to the user's role (student or tutor).
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular persistence and logic layers make future expansion (e.g., admin panel or reporting tools) possible.
