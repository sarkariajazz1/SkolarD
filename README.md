#  Vision Statement

SkolarD is a platform designed to help post-secondary students easily and conveniently book in-person tutoring sessions. Students can search for tutors based on the specific courses they teach and their teaching styles. Once a tutor is selected, students can view availability and schedule a session that works for both parties. Students also have the option to directly message tutors with any questions or concerns.

This service is intended for students enrolled in universities, colleges, or technical institutions who are struggling with specific courses or concepts. Many students face difficulties finding tutors who have taken the same course or understand how it's taught at their institution. This challenge is especially common in science and technical programs, where subject-specific support is often limited. Tutors may be peers who have successfully completed the course or instructors with relevant expertise. Since course content can vary between institutions, SkolarD emphasizes matching students with tutors familiar with their exact course material, minimizing the risk of irrelevant or redundant help.

SkolarD allows individuals to act as a tutor, a student, or both. Tutors can list the courses they are qualified to teach, while students can browse listings to find someone suited to their academic needs. Tutors benefit by strengthening their mentorship skills and reinforcing their own understanding of the material. Since tutors can also be students, the app supports a peer-based learning environment, where knowledge-sharing helps build a stronger academic community.

The core value of SkolarD lies in its ability to match students with tutors who align with their learning preferences and course requirements. This ensures each tutoring session is more effective and personalized. The overall goal is to improve academic performance by helping students gain confidence through targeted support from tutors who understand both the material and the studentsâ€™ learning needs.

SkolarD will launch as a website accessible to all users, with plans to expand to other platforms in the future. Students will be able to book sessions, and tutors will manage their listings and availability. All user data and communications will remain private.

SkolarD will be considered successful if, within the first year, 10,000 students register on the platform and at least half of them book one or more tutoring sessions. Additionally, success will be measured through engagement and academic outcomes: 40% of students should book repeat sessions within 30 days, and students should book an average of three sessions per semester. To assess academic impact, 60% of users should report improved academic performance, as verified through optional self-reported GPA scores. Overall user satisfaction will also be evaluated, with the goal of achieving an average rating of 4 out of 5 or higher through anonymous user surveys. These measurable outcomes will help determine the effectiveness and reach of the platform while guiding future development.
